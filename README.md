## Q1:
Customer Relational Management tools (CRMs) are an essential tool to manage, prioritise and track your business' interactions with clients/customers and stakeholders. From freelancers and small business owners to large enterprises, a CRM is the essential key to handling and strengthening customer relationships.

From my experience in working with small businesses, finding the right CRM tool for your business can be tough - where some may have to seek multiple tools (such as Monday, Notion and Asana) to create the optimal managerial customer-relationship system.
Because of this, CRMs are often customised according to a businesses' needs through web development, with the collaboration of input from owner/s, stakeholders and management.

I have built a customised, high-level CRM API web server for this purpose, and to create the foundation for freelancers and small businesses to build upon and customise to their needs.
