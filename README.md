## Q1:

### **Identification of the _problem_ you are trying to solve by building this particular _app_.**

Customer Relational Management tools (CRMs) are an essential tool to manage, prioritise and track your business' interactions with clients/customers and stakeholders. From freelancers and small business owners to large enterprises, a CRM is the essential key to handling and strengthening customer relationships.

From my experience in working with small businesses, finding the right CRM tool for your business can be tough - where some may have to seek multiple tools (such as Monday, Notion and Asana) to create the optimal managerial customer-relationship system.
Because of this, CRMs are often customised according to a businesses' needs through web development, with the collaboration of input from owner/s, stakeholders and management.

I have built a customised, high-level CRM API web server for this purpose, and to create the foundation for freelancers and small businesses to build upon and customise to their needs.

## Q2:

### **Why is it a _problem_ that needs solving?**

Using multiple management tools from third-party services can get the job done, but in turn has inefficiencies that can slow down a company's customer pipeline and ultimately disrupt an important client relationship through simple confusion and miscommunication.

Building custom CRMs are most commonly seen in larger enterprise settings, where businesses handling a larger sum of clients and stakeholders require a more customised CRM to more effectively handle their client/stakeholder database.

**Benefits to using a customised CRM:**

- Maximises productivity and management processes:
  - More straightforward and easier to navigate (especially during onboarding).
  - Includes features and functionality specifically designed for the business' maximum efficiency.
- Expedites team workflow through customised management features.
- Faults/bugs in the CRM can be handled internally and immediately.
- Stricter encryption and authentication methods can be used to strengthen data security.
- Database is locally managed - Privileges and access of this database can be managed according to role, reducing the risk of data inaccuracy and inconsistency.

However, custom development is not cheap. It may be a high cost for a small business or freelancer to fund developers to create a customised CRM (hence why this is implemented more on larger-scaled enterprises). Due to this, I have built the foundations of a CRM API web server to lessen the time and costs for the development process when built upon as a full-scale web app.
